# TrainSchedule

This project is for displaying the train schedules of the trains added. This app also allows to add a new train.
When ever a new train is added, the train details are displayed in the table holding the trains information.
The information displayed for the convenience of the users are as below
1. Train name
2. Destination
3. Frequency
4. Next Arrival(calculated based on the First start time input when the train is added)
5. Minutes away from the current time.

Firebase is used to store the data. MomentJS library is used to calculate the next arrival and minutes away.

Future Enhancements

1. Option to edit the train details in the table

2. option to delete the train information.
